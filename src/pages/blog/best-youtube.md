Here's my list of the best channels for entrepreneurs. Here you get taught how to get your business running, what you need to do in order to prepare you for success. World class entrepreneurs are showing you their mindsets, thus opening you a new way of seeing the world. But don't get soaked up by the videos, don't forget to take the action. Just getting the motivation isn't enough. You need to always take action.
